# Tutorial Template

This is a simple template that can be used to write tutorials in HTML5 code. The template includes a basic HTML structure with placeholders for a title, subtitle, and text content, as well as some CSS files that provide some basic styling.

## Getting Started

To use this template, simply fill in the placeholders in template.html with your own content. You can use any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) that supports HTML to edit the file. I have also packed the CSS and images for you to test what your tutorial looks like in our website.

### Basic HTML5 Knowledge

#### HTML5 Concepts
Some of the key concepts in our template.html:

\<h2>: The element is a level 2 heading with a class attribute set to "Title". This element is used to display the project name or title.

\<h3>: The element is a level 3 heading with a class attribute set to "Subtitle". This element is used to display a subtitle or heading for a specific section of the tutorial.

\<span>: The \<span> element inside the \<h3> element is used to apply styling or formatting to the text inside it. In this case, it is used to make the text bold. The \<span> element inside the \<p> element is also used for styling or formatting. It is also recommend to wrap each paragraph with <span> tags.
